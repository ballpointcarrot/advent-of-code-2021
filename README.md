# Aoc2021

**Advent of Code 2021**

This is my set of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems for 2021.

This year, we're doing Elixir as the language of choice. In previous years, we've done [Rust](https://github.com/ballpointcarrot/aoc-2020-rust) and [Clojure](https://github.com/ballpointcarrot/AoC/tree/desktop).

## Installation

Don't. It's just a source repo. Pull it down locally, and run the test files to get the problem answers.
